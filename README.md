# K-Means-Clustering

## Introduction

This project aims to show the application of the Skitlearn K-Means algorithm to identify clusters in a 
synthetic dataset. 

The main purpose of this project is to showcase proficiency in applying clustering algorithms.

## Technical Details

- **Data Creation**: Generated a synthetic dataset using make_blobs for clustering analysis.
- **Determined Optimal Clusters**: Used the Elbow and Silhouette methods to find the ideal number of clusters.
- **Applied K-Means Clustering**: Implemented K-Means with the optimal number of clusters.
- **Evaluated Performance**: Used a confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of clustering results.
