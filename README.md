# K-Means Clustering

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the application of the K-Means algorithm from Scikit-learn in Python to identify clusters in a synthetic dataset.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase proficiency in applying clustering algorithms.

## Technical Details

- **Data Creation**: Generated a synthetic dataset using make_blobs for clustering analysis.
- **Determined Optimal Clusters**: Used the Elbow and Silhouette methods to find the ideal number of clusters.
- **Applied K-Means Clustering**: Implemented K-Means with the optimal number of clusters.
- **Evaluated Performance**: Used a confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of clustering results.

## Impact

Established a robust methodology for clustering analysis, providing data scientists and analysts with effective techniques for data segmentation and enhancing data-driven recommendations.

## Visuals

Bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, and confusion matrix.

## Dependency Versions

The Python environment used in this project can be set up in Anaconda using the python_env.yaml file.
