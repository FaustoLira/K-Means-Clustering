# K-Means-Clustering

This project aims to show the application of the K-Means algorithm to identify clusters in a synthetic dataset. I applied K-Means to group randomly generated data using the make_blobs function from scikit-learn.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase proficiency in applying clustering algorithms.
